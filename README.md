# Comparing Perturbed Optimizer and Barrier Function Methods for Differentiating Linear Programs
This repository contains all my work for my Engineering (R&D) honours project at the Australian National University under the supervision of Prof. Stephen Gould in 2021. My research project sets up on the novel [Deep Declarative Network (DDN)](https://github.com/anucvml/ddn), in which we focus on [barrier function](https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.05447) and [perturbed optimizer](Learning with Differentiable Perturbed Optimizers) methods to compare which one is better in supporting Linear Programs (LP) as a declarative node in end-to-end learnable networks.

We have concluded barrier function method is a better choice for small scale LPs and/or LPs with element-wise constraints, perturbed optimizer is more versatile against various convex optimization problem solvers and higher dimensional LPs. For more detail please refer to my [Thesis](https://github.com/Mingrui12/Comparing-Perturbed-Optimizer-and-Barrier-Function-Methods-for-Differentiating-Linear-Programs/blob/main/Thesis.pdf). A quick overview of my project and results is provided in my [project seminar slide](https://github.com/Mingrui12/Comparing-Perturbed-Optimizer-and-Barrier-Function-Methods-for-Differentiating-Linear-Programs/blob/main/Project_Seminar.pdf).
